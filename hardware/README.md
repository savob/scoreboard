Both these boards were made in EAGLE, but are now in KiCad (7.0.10) format. 

`detector` was meant to pickup a ball passing over a switch and make a single pulse using a 555 timer in monostable mode. A friend made this board.

`timeboard` was meant to be the main board for the system which would actually keep track of the score and display information like time remaining on the display for players to see.
